# TODO: 2.
#   Define a complete program that:
#     a.  Imports  rosegraphics
#     b.  Defines a   main   function that:
#          - Constructs a TurtleWindow.
#          - Calls the function that YOU define (see next bullet, below) TWICE
#              (with different arguments each time) to TEST your function.
#          - Asks the TurtleWindow to wait for a mouse click, then close.
#     c.  Defines another function that takes three parameters:
#             a SimpleTurtle, a string that represents a color,
#             and an integer for the distance to move (in pixels),
#         and causes the SimpleTurtle to:
#           - Move backward the given distance.
#           - Change its Pen's color to the given color.
#           - Turn left 90 degrees.
#           - Move forward twice the given distance.
#     d.  Calls main.
